  <Process id="st_boundingbox">
    <Abstract>This algorithm generates a new vector layer with a single
      polygon representing the bounding box of an input vector layer.

  </Process>

  <Process id="st_centroids">
    <Abstract>Creates a new points layer with the centroids of the
      polygons in a given layer.</Abstract>
  </Process>

  <Process id="st_changelinedirection">
    <Abstract>This algorithm inverts the ordering of vertices in a line,
      thus reversing its orientation.</Abstract>
  </Process>

  <Process id="st_cleanpointslayer">
    <Abstract>This algorithm eliminates duplicated points. If several
      points with the same coordinates appear in a layer, the algorithm
      will leave just the first one of them, removing the remaining
      ones.</Abstract>
  </Process>

  <Process id="st_cleanvectorlayer">
    <Abstract>This algorithms checks the integrity of the attributes
      tables of a vector layer and removes invalid features (features
      with missing attributes or invalid values). The number of invalid
      features is shown in a message in the SEXTANTE log window.

  <Process id="st_clip">
    <Abstract>This algorithm clips a vector layer using the polygons
      from an additional polygons layer.</Abstract>

      given vector layer.</Abstract>

  <Process id="st_geometricpropertieslines">
    <Abstract>This algorithm computes some geometric properties of the

  <Process id="st_geometriestopoints">
    <Abstract>This algorithm generates a new points layer, taking all
      nodes from an input vector layer. Attributes of each point are
      taken from the geometry it belongs to.</Abstract>
  </Process>

  <Process id="st_intersection">
    <Abstract>This algorithm computes the intersection between two
      polygon vector layers. This is equivalent to a boolean AND
      operator. The geometries are altered and attributes table of the
      resulting layer contains as many fields as the union of both input
      attributes tables, as shown in the following picture.</Abstract>

  <Process id="st_pointcoordinates">
    <Abstract>This algorithm takes a points layer and generates a new
      layer with those same points, but adding two new fields (X and Y)
      to its attributes table, containing X and Y coordinates of each
      point</Abstract>

  <Process id="st_polylinestopolygons">
    <Abstract>This algorithm converts polylines to polygons. Each
      polygon gets the attributes of the polyline it was created from.
    </Abstract>
  </Process>

  <Process id="st_polylinestosinglesegments">
    <Abstract>This algorithm takes a lines layer and generates a new
      lines layer where each line has been substituted by a single
      segment (a line with just two nodes), which best approximate the
      direction and shape of the input line.
    </Abstract>
  </Process>

  <Process id="st_removeholes">
    <Abstract>This algorithm removes holes from polygons in a polygon
      layer. A hole is an empty area within a polygon. Polygons with
      holes are defined as a envelope polygon (the outer contour) and a
      set of inner ones (the holes). This algorithm transform each
      polygon, removing those inner subpolygons and leaving just the
      outer one.</Abstract>

  <Process id="st_splitmultipart">
    <Abstract>This algorithm separates those features that contains more
      than one single geometry. The resulting layer will contain each
      one of those geometries in a different feature. All features will
      share the same associated attributes.</Abstract>
