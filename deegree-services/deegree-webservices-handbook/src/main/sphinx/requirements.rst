System requirements
-------------------

In order to run deegree, you will need

* Oracle Java 6 JDK, Update 4 or better. We recommend using the latest Java 6 version. Java 7 should also work, but is not as well tested.

Additional components

* Web application container that implements Java's servlet 2.5 specification. We recommend the latest Tomcat 7 version.
* PostgreSQL (8.3, 8.4 or 9.0) with PostGIS (1.4 or 1.5)
* Oracle Spatial (9i, 10g, 11g). You will need the Oracle JDBC driver (version???)

--------------------
Download and startup
--------------------

deegree 3.1 webservice downloads are available at http://wiki.deegree.org/deegreeWiki/DownloadPage. You can choose between two versions:

* ZIP download: Multi-operating system download that contains a bundled Apache Tomcat container. Just unpack the archive and fire up the starter for your operating system.
* WAR download: Web archive download suitable if you already have a servlet container on your machine.
